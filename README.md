# Matlab

To program a computer you have to use a programming language. There are a lot of them. You may have heard of some of them, C++, Java, for example. But for this course we've decided to use a programming language that you may not have heard of. It's called MATLAB.The purpose of MATLAB'S designers was to make programming easier, especially for solving numerical problems.And they succeeded. MATLAB is very easy to use and to learn. And at the same time, it's very powerful.

It's used world-wide by professionals, from scientists to engineers, to economists.

Many of the devices you use daily, your car, your smart phone, have features and components that were developed with the help of MATLAB. When you see the news about a NASA mission, you can be pretty sure that their programmers and computer experts used MATLAB to make it happen. Our purpose with this course is to teach the basics of computer programming and MATLAB. The level of the course is that of a college introductory first-year course. It's nine weeks long, including eight weeks of video lectures, and one week for a final homework submission. If you follow along with us try all the examples as you'll see. Do the quizzes and the homeworks, then by the end of the ninth week you'll be able to program a computer. In fact you'll be good at it. And you should have fun doing it.
